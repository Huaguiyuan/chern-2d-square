Calculates the Chern number of a 2D lattice. The batch file chern.sh submits the parallelized code using Slurm Workload Manager, run_chern.m contains the parameters and calls chern.m to calculate the Chern number. After this the script collect_chern.m is manually called to collect the data. The script check.py can be used to check which of the batch jobs did not finish.
